## Welcome To The Erase Hitlers Mistakes Project

We are a community of 6th graders who have come together to try and showt teach future generations about Hitlers mistakes.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

#### Mardown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

We were inspired by the Wittwell Tennesse paper clip project  .[There website](http://www.oneclipatatime.org/paper-clips-project/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Ethan123123/Earasers/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
